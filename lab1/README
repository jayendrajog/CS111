Based off our understanding of the specifications of this project, our project meets all requirements as specified on the class
website. While inefficient methods were used in some cases (using a linear search instead of a O(1) hash table search that would
have been possible), in general there are no known limitations that detract from the accuracy of the output, and even the 
performance of the program is good for the small sizes of n that exist in this case.
